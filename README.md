# golang-dev-tools
Meta repository for a set of golang development tools

## Installation
Prebuilt binaries packaged in a tar-ball for some operating systems and architectures can be [downloaded from the releases section](https://github.com/HeavyWombat/golang-dev-tools/releases/latest).

There is a convenience script to download the latest release for Linux or macOS if you want to keep it simple (you need `curl` and `jq` installed on your machine):
```bash
curl --silent --location https://goo.gl/g1CpPX | bash
```
